Create WebLogic DataSource with WLST
===============

1. Set your MW_HOME environment variable

``
export MW_HOME=/Developer/oracle/wls12120 
``

2. From your "wlst-datasource" directory:

``
$ . $MW_HOME/wlserver/server/bin/setWLSEnv.sh
``

Notice the "." before invoking setWLSEnv.sh.

3. Change the ds.properties file accordingly and can call

``java weblogic.WLST create-ds.py``

You should see an output similar to:

```
